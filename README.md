##### Additional notes or common issues that future developers might benefit from knowing

* Both terminal will be required to run at the same time in-oder for the function to work. 
* After certain time period, the database have to be cleared following the Retention period in PDPA
* If functions are not working, can try FIRST checking the backend services on the terminal.
* There is a [user documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fogM80EYCgvqwZCYcCoMweFyaElYIL8CLj1dcAoh1oo/edit?usp=sharing) available on how to use the application for users.

## Pull Request Strategy
1. Nominates a git master to manage all the **Pull Request**. 
2. Developers may create a Pull Request after tested the code. 
3. Git master will check on the new code, resolve the merge conflict and approve the Pull Request.

## Versioning Strategy
#### Rules of Version Number: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH 

MAJOR - version is incremented when you make any breaking change

MINOR - version is incremented when you add a new feature/functionality

PATCH - version is incremented when you make bug fixes

#### Strategy
1. Git Master creates a new release on GitHub
2. Choose the release branch as the target branch
3. Add the title based on the versioning strategy specified
4. Add release notes and changelogs for the new release
5. Publish the new release
